	<p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
	</q>start of a paragraph is indicated by a newline.
	</p>

	<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
	into units of text. For example, a book may have
	chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
	each heading there will be one or more
	paragraphs.
